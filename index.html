            Messi, 32, took home the golden gong in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2015,
            and has featured among the top three finalists more times (11) than any other player.
            And despite an injury hit 2018-19 campaign, he has netted nine times in seven games
            throughout October and November.

            Reports in the Spanish press claimed the Argentina international had
            been tipped off about his win ahead of the glittering ceremony in the French
            capital, hence arriving on Barcelona's private jet to collect the accolade,
            with his wife Antonella Roccuzzo and two children excitedly watching on.

            Speaking in the midst of a world media circus and tightly clutching
            his award, Messi said: 'I am very grateful to the people of Barcelona and all
            the affection they show to me. It's a special day and this award means so much
            and I am very happy.

            'The truth is that the routine doesn't allow me much time to stop and
            think and enjoy all that we have achieved. I will enjoy it today and enjoy
            time with my family, then start thinking about what is coming next, as I always do.

            'I will think about all I have achieved as soon as I have time. But at
            the moment everything is going so fast that I can only think about the next game.'

            He later added: 'As we saw in the video it was
            ten years ago when I received my first Balon d'Or in Paris. I remember that I
            came with my three siblings. I was 22-years-old. It was unthinkable what I was experiencing.

            'Now ten years later I'm receiving the sixth one in a totally different, very special,
            moment in my life with my wife and my three sons who am I lucky enough to have
            here with me tonight along with my brother and one of the many nephews that I have
            and as my wife said in the message in all this time I have never stopped dreaming
            and desiring to keep growing and keep getting better day after day and above all keep
            enjoying football.
